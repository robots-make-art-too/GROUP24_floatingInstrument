For our project we decided to go with a Mario Kart themed AR game-like experience (hence floatingGame). Using our QR code it will take you to our website with a link to our very own AR camera! From there, you will have to find our markers around the city (or as I put in the website just to print –for now) to “unlock” a Mario Kart character. We decided to use already made up 3D models just based off of time but we would definitely like to make and use our own in the future. Something I would change would be the markers. I think that they should represent something Mario themed like the little [question mark block](img/question.png) that I added to the website. This way people will get a hint as to what they're looking for without totally giving it away and create more excitement around the markers. I think we would also benefit from some cool animations if we wanted to explore this project even further.
