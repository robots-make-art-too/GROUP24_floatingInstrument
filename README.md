For our project we decided to go with a Mario Kart themed AR game-like experience (floatingGame). Using our QR code it will take you to our website with a link to our very own AR camera! From there, you will have to find our markers around the city (or as I put in the website just to print –for now) to “unlock” a Mario Kart character. I think it would be fun if in future the markers were the little question mark block [link to ?] (img/question.png) that i added to the website so people will know automatically what they're looking for.
