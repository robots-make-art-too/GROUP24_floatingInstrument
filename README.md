For our project we decided to go with a Mario Kart themed AR game-like experience (hence floatingGame). Using our QR code it will take you to our website with a link to our very own AR camera! From there, you will have to find our markers around the city (or as I put in the website just to print –for now) to “unlock” a Mario Kart character. We decided to use already made up 3D models just based off of time but we would definitely like to make and use our own in the future. I think it would be fun if in future the markers were the little [question mark block](img/question.png) that I added to the website. This way people will get a hint to what they're looking for. I think we would also benefit from some cool animations if we wanted to explore this project even further.
